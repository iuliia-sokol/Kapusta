# Kapu$ta Project

Keeping your financial life organised can help you save time and money.

Kapu$ta is a finance management App, that can be helpful for saving and managing information of user's financial activities and provides financial infographics for selected period of time. It's main goal, lets say, is to keep user from overspending.

Kapu$ta might attract both users, who prefer to keep their bills and financial records well organised, and ones, willing to make it a habit to review their budget in order to improve their financial well-being.
